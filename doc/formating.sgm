		<title>Format Strings</title>
		<para>
			Yup, RLIB has them, in fact two distinct formats, one legacy and one "new style", see below..
			The legacy format string work similar but not identical to C. It can format number, string or date values.
			It works a lot like printf format strings in C, with optional length and precision specifiers.
			The format string may also contain literals before and after the format specifier for the
			value.
		</para>
		<para>
			Numbers are denoted by conversion specifier '%d'. Examples: '%d', '%10.2d' or 'You have %d apples'.
			Unlike C format strings, the optional [length][.[precision]] works in a way that
			the "length" part only influences the integer part of the number instead of the
			whole length of the formatted output.
		</para>
		<para>
			For US-specific monetary formatting with numeric grouping separator, use '%$d'.
			For example, Example: '%$d', '%$5.2d'. The second would result '12,345.67'.
		</para>
		<para>
			For incorrect format strings, RLIB will put an error message in the field.
			They are...
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F means that RLIB was not given a format string and can't automatically make something of your data
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F_D means you asked RLIB to format as a number but it was not given a number data type
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F_S means you asked RLIB to format as a string but it was not given a string data type
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_F_F means RLIB could not interperate your format string expression / or what it interpreted it to was not a string
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>New Style Format Strings with "!" prefix</title>
		<para>
			The new style format strings can be intermixed with old style formatting and may be used anywhere a format string is needed.
			They provide locale aware formatting for date/time, money and numbers.
			The first 2 characters in the new format strings must begin with either "!@", "!$" or "!#", respectively.
			Following this is an appropriate 'C' style format string for one of the functions
			strftime, strfmon, or sprintf (for numbers).
			The conversion specifiers in number format strings must be 'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g' or 'G'.
			The conversion specifiers in monetary format strings must be 'i' or 'n', for international or national formatting, respectively.
			For example "!#$.2g", "!$%n", "!@%m/%d/%Y" are valid format strings using the new style for a number, a money amount and a date.
			There are also additional error codes added	as follows:
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_DT_D means you asked RLIB to format a date but the date field of the datetime is not set.
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_DT_T means you asked RLIB to format a time but the time field of the datetime is not set.
		</para>
		<para>
			!ERR_DT_NO means there were no valid format codes in a format string for a date/time.
		</para>
	</sect1>		
	<sect1>
		<title>String Format Strings</title>
		<para>
			Exactly like C. %[length]s where length is how long to make the string.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>Number Format Strings</title>
		<para>
			Close to C: %[0][integer length][.[decimal precision]]d
		</para>
		<para>
			Integer length indicates the intended length of the integer part of the number. Just like for printf in C,
			this length can be exceeded if the number is actually larger than what would fit in the specified length.
			If the printed integer part is shorter than the specified length, then it will be left padded up to the specified length,
			by default with spaces. If '0' is added before the length specifier, the number will be 0-padded on the left.
			Decimal precision specifies how many decimal places should be printed from the number.
			Note that other XML attributes for the report field where this value is printed, like width and align
			will also influence the way the number is shown in the report. The character 'd' at the end is mandatory and
			says it is a number.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>Number Format Strings (!# format)</title>
		<para>
			Identical to C. All numbers must be represented by the 'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g' or 'G' conversion specifiers.
		</para>	
		<para>
			Please refer to your systems printf formatting codes.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>Date Format Strings (all including !@ format)</title>
		<para>
			Date codes and time codes should be consecutive, i.e. don't have a timecode a datecode and then another timecode.
			This will not work. Rlib internally splits the datetime string into a date format string and a time format string.
			It uses the first transition from date-to-time or time-to-date as the split point for the date/time.
		</para>
		<para>
			Dates from 1/1/1 through 1/1/8000+ can be represented.
